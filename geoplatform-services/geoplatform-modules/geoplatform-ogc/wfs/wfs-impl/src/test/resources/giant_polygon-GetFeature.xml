      Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
      making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and
      conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

      As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission
      to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless
      of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute
      the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
      for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of
      that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
      based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception
      to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not
      wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
